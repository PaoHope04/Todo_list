# Todo's List in console

This application is created in Node.js with the use of the NPM Inquirer and Colors package to style the application.

This application does not have a database as such, but a json file that works as a database
It's a small project but quite significant since it's part of my node.js learning.

I hope you like this project and if you can support me by adding yourself to my Linkedin network, I would really appreciate it 😄

thanks ❤️
